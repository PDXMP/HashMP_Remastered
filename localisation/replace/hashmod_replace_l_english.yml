Their manifesto has been circulating among the Ruthenian populace, and some of their leaders have privately contacted us requesting our cooperation as they seek to transition the state's identity. It's at least worth considering...\n\nCenturies ago the land of the Rus' was united under a single banner and ruled from the legendary city Kiev. But then came the Mongol hordes, advancing from the great steppe, pillaging and burning. They destroyed our kremlins and the towns fell one by one, even Kiev itself could not avoid this fate. In terror our people fled the plains of Rus' and went north. Into the forests and hinterlands of the land we today call Russia.\nNow a new and arrogant city of the north is on the rise. It draws in the petty states around it and its ruler envisions a new Rus'. A Rus' centered in Moscow and not Kiev.\nHowever us Ruthenians will not go silent into the pages of history. We will not allow newcomers and pretenders to claim the legacy of our forefathers. Kiev shall rise once gain and we shall restore it to its former glory and splendor. So too shall the Rus'."
